# Usage with dub:

Add "pixelperfectengine:pixelperfectengine" to the dependencies.

# Usage with most IDEs:

1: Download and build the source. You will need both the engine and editor by default, as the engine uses its own custom bitmap format XMP due to its more advanced palette handling. Other advantages of the format is that it can store multiple bitmaps in a single file with no regard of their sizes.
2: Add /source/ to the include path.
3: Add the compiled library file in the /lib/ folder to your project.
4: Do not try to sell a subpar game written with this or any other engine on any storefront, especially if that barely has any original assets. :)
